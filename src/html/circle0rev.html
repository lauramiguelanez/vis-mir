  Massaging the Asylum System as Lumbung Practice
</h3>

<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>

<p>
  Curated by Trampoline House Artistic Team members Carlota Mir and Sara Alberani, Massaging the
  Asylum System is a collaboration between two collectives and <strong>Lumbung members*</strong> at
  documenta fifteen: Copenhagen-based refugee justice centre Trampoline House and UK-based
  neurodiverse collective Project Art Works.
</p>

<p>
  Massaging the Asylum System is a joint exploration of the relationship between people’s rights as
  they seek asylum and try to rebuild their lives in Denmark, and how different systems, from the
  State to Danish society, may or may not respect those rights. Supported by preliminary work and
  visits, informal talks, public speaking, collective research within the Lumbung community, and the
  forging of relationships, the collaboration came to fruition with two public workshop series: one
  in Copenhagen, where we invited Project Art Works to pick apart the asylum system in Denmark
  together with the Trampoline House community, and one in Kassel, where we took these learnings
  from the House and then gathered in our respective exhibition spaces, inviting documenta
  audiences, to re-imagine asylum together. Intersecting two very different, yet touching realities,
  our work became a <strong>temporary coalition</strong> of dissident bodies.
</p>

<p>
  Initiated by Mir and Alberani, the collaboration was funded with money from the Lumbung
  <strong>collective pot*</strong> after approval from all Lumbung members. The group made decisions
  on projects to be funded according to shared lumbung values: projects should be locally anchored,
  regenerative and be driven by generosity, sufficiency, humour, independence, and transparency.
  Related to the overarching concept of <strong>Lumbung*</strong>, the collective pot was a
  collectively governed economic resource that worked as a way to speculate artistically on how to
  build and maintain such a common structure over time. Lumbung is both a community and an
  infrastructure of resources that sustains artistic projects that are rooted in life, an approach
  that subverts the logic of artificially producing works for a biennial.

<p>
  Massaging the Asylum System was unique in its alliance of two Lumbung members with decades of
  experience in their fields, bringing together their situated knowledge to make something new. The
  project emerged from the shared affinities between both organisations that were discovered during
  the Lumbung process. Both <strong>Trampoline House</strong> and
  <strong>roject Art Works</strong> work at the intersection of art and activism in their field to
  produce equity within their communities. In this sense, it is not a coincidence that they were two
  of the few Europe-based organisations that participated in documenta fifteen. Though situated in
  the Global North, Trampoline House deals with the effects of European institutional racism and
  colonial violence in the Global South, such as migration and forced displacement, thus making its
  work to support people in an extremely hostile asylum system an essential contribution to
  documenta fifteen. As for Project Art Works, they are a collective of neurodiverse artists and
  activists that works with art and care. Based in Hastings, UK, their focus is on makers and
  artists who, because of complex support needs, experience the world differently to what
  neurotypical societies think of as ‘normal’, challenging normative canons of accessibility to
  public life through advocacy and artistic action. Through their practice, both organisations stand
  by the belief that using art to create visibility is particularly necessary in the case of
  communities who are marginalised within the already marginalised: rejected asylum seekers, people
  who are neurodivergent and/or have profound learning disabilities and complex support needs; these
  are all collectives for whom invisibility and marginalisation within already marginalised groups
  is a daily reality.

<p><strong>Harvest & Navigation</strong></p>

<p>
  Entitled Cosmologies of Asylum as a reference to both Project Art Works’ artistic methodologies
  and Trampoline House’s community, this <strong>harvest*</strong> presents the fruits of a
  two-year-long collective conversation between the artistic teams and the larger communities which
  make up both organisations and whose voices resonate here.
</p>

<p>
  The harvest centres a specific artistic tool from Project Art Works that became key for the
  collaboration: the <strong>Cosmologies of Care</strong>. These are circular drawings that
  originally represented the lives of neurodivergent people and helped visualise social systems of
  care in the UK, which are typically adversarial and hard to navigate. In the workshops, we
  translated and adapted this tool into the context of asylum in Denmark, first by understanding the
  system, and then learning how we could ‘massage’ it together so that it could become softer and
  more humane.
</p>

<p>
  Beginning with how the Cosmologies of Care were first created by Project Art Works artist Kate
  Adams as individual tools for self-awareness, the harvest is made of a
  <strong>circular map</strong> that follows the cosmologies as they move through the emotional and
  physical spaces of Project Art Works, Trampoline House and documenta fifteen at different stages
  of the process. Through ongoing circulation, translations and shifts, the cosmologies become
  strong consciousness-raising tools that help not only detect malaise, navigate adversarial
  systems, express anger, and make visible the invisible: they also become essential to voice
  desires, aspirations and utopias, bringing resilience alongside possible, more joyful futures into
  perspective.
</p>

<p>
  Forming concentric layers, translation, circulation, and <strong>circularity</strong> emerge as
  ongoing motion - artistic practices abandon rigid, individual and authorial forms to shift shape,
  transform and merge: they become vehicles to tell the stories of different communities and the
  systems they are administered by, make the invisible visible, and build solidarity-based alliances
  among locales and in an exhibition space which became embodied otherwise.

  Around the circular drawings, several clickable islands represent the dichotomies and ongoing
  tensions that our work and communities move between:
  <strong
    >care/control, alliance/division, health/illness, solidarity/hostility,
    access/invisibility</strong
  >. Collecting visual materials and citations from Project Art Works and Trampoline House artists,
  activists, and community members, alongside other authors and their theoretical approaches to the
  themes that emerged in the collaboration, these islands work as an open-ended, alternative
  bibliography of the project.
</p>

<p>
  Embedded within the circular landscape, little clickable icons point to the different sites that
  conform the <strong>ecosystem</strong> of this project:
  <strong>Trampoline House, Project Art Works</strong>, a twin harvest of the project, curated by
  Mir and Alberani for our independent Trampoline House publisher <strong>visAvis</strong>, and the
  online documenta archive <strong>Lumbung dot Space</strong>. Finally, the lighthouse at the bottom
  of the page provides access to the full collaboration timeline between Trampoline House and
  Project Art Works during the Lumbung process.

  From the Act of Massaging to Making Cosmologies: Circularity, Circulation and Reciprocity as
  Methods
</h3>

<p>
  A massage is a caring action directed to the body that, through intimate connection and applying
  pressure, aims to relieve tension and pain. A practice that must involve two or more people, the
  massage invites openness and the softening of rigid tissues, encouraging gentle healing. With
  ‘massaging’ as a guiding principle, we merged our practices in spirit and materiality. Together,
  we looked at the ambiguous social systems of care and control that operate on neurodivergent and
  migrant communities alike, how to navigate them, and what the role of art in that conversation
  could be: could we massage the system?
</p>

<p>
  As Shakira Kasigwa Mukamusoni from Trampoline House describes it in her film installation The
  Chain, produced for documenta fifteen, the asylum system in Denmark is like a ‘chain’: this means
  that people are stuck in a legal grey zone, neither detained nor free, but without prospects of
  pursuing a future life in Denmark or in Europe. ‘The chain’ is a structurally violent strategy of
  exhaustion that works by generating an endless succession of physical and emotional restrictions
  aimed to deter people from attaining - and seeking - asylum. In other words, the system works, in
  great measure, by creating sad emotions.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>
  In coming together and using creative tools, Trampoline House and Project Art Works sought to face
  the asylum system, connecting our bodies to our ability to imagine and act. To this end, we tapped
  into the inner knowledge of Trampoline House and Project Art Works: as our practices show,
  self-determined positions coming from relationships, joy, creative work, or access to social life
  have to do with the possibility of acting, and they are fundamental for restoring dignity and
  agency where the system has taken it away. In preparation for the workshops, we asked our
  communities: which creative processes of self-care and self-empowerment can someone take up to
  face a violent system? Which ones can we take up together and which ones depend on our different
  positions and privileges? How can we create solidarity networks and share knowledge among people
  who may need complex support in different ways? Through shared affect, time and creative action,
  our aim was to massage a rigid and inhumane asylum system - yes, massage, like a real massage - so
  that it could become softer and more humane.
</p>

<p>
  In the workshops, we merged the knowledge and methods from both organisations to create spaces for
  dialogue and friendship. Project Art Works’ methodologies were hosted within the structure and
  spirit of Trampoline House’s house meetings, which are typically formed by a very diverse group of
  people - from rejected asylum seekers to people with temporary residence permits, artists,
  interns, activists, kids, and the elderly. In House meetings, the assembly structure allows for
  horizontal participation and collective ‘deprogramming’ of all present: this means an unlearning
  of our habitual positions and stepping down from our privileges to be able to really meet the
  other.
</p>

<p>
  In this process of sharing conversations and strategies, visualising systems of care and control,
  and repositioning ourselves and our communities in them, Project Art Works’
  <strong>Cosmologies of Care</strong>
  became central. These drawings, which can vary in size and scope, from the individual to the
  collective, from small to large, are tools that help visualise the systems of social care that
  neurodivergent/disabled people in the UK and their families must go through to get their needs
  met. Created by artist Kate Adams, who is also the mother of a man with complex support needs
  <strong>(Circle I)</strong>, the drawings also make care visible as a vital form of labour, and
  help visualise deeper human aspirations - from choice in who to spend time with to living close to
  the sea. Aspirations, no matter how big or small, are often overlooked and neglected in the lives
  of people with disabilities, as a result of the objectification brought about by standardised
  forms of social care; a striking similarity, we found, to the way refugee lives are handled in
  fortress Europe.
</p>

<div class="img-caption">

</div>

<p>
  Inspired by these drawings, our collaboration departed from the realisation that there were
  evident parallels between the complex systems of care and control that administer both
  communities: as it first occurred to us during our first encounter in person in Project Art Works’
  Turner Prize exhibition in November 2021 <strong>(Circle II)</strong>, the cosmologies could be
  useful to make visible the lives of refugee communities and the complexities of the asylum system
  in Denmark, and to reclaim agency and change within it. Translating the cosmologies into the
  context of asylum underlined their worth as an endlessly adaptable practice that puts people in
  the centre, helps raise self awareness, makes visible infrastructures, trauma and desires, and
  articulates individual thoughts and feelings as part of larger systems and collective
  constellations.
</p>

<p>
  Parallel to cosmology drawing, live portrait-making became also important. A tool developped by
  Project Art Works, <strong>solar prints</strong> are large portraits made with a special blue ink
  that is sensitive to sunlight and develops instantly with sun exposure. The slow process of making
  portraits of each other together, as we made cosmologies about the asylum system and discussed
  life and citizenship, allowed us to get to know one another informally and share stories over the
  course of the different workshops. These moments revealed themselves as vital, as they recognised
  the need to be seen, which is so neglected in both neurodivergent communities and the asylum
  system: while some people donated their portraits to the project archive, for others it was
  important to take them home.

<p>
  We first used the cosmologies in the first workshop series in Trampoline House in May 2022 to look
  more closely at the asylum system in Denmark <strong>(Circle IV)</strong>. With facilitation by me
  and Sara Alberani, Tone Olaf Nielsen and Nabila Saidi (Trampoline House); Kate Adams and Tim
  Corrigan (Project Art Works), we looked at the support infrastructures that people have during the
  various phases of asylum - from the government but also from family, friends, community or
  Trampoline House - and the ones they don’t have, especially as rejected asylum seekers. Starting
  with large collective warm-up drawings, we made a first round of individual cosmologies where
  people reflected on their support networks, both in Denmark and abroad. We then made a collective
  cosmology illustrating the different phases of asylum and what can happen when people get stuck in
  grey areas for years.

<p>
  Through cosmology drawings guided by people with migration experience, both from Ukraine and other
  countries, we were then able to compare how the asylum system operates on migrants from the Global
  South versus how the system was modified to facilitate the arrival of Ukrainian refugees, coming
  to the conclusion that a better asylum system is not a utopia, but a simple matter of political
  will<sup>2</sup>. We concluded our sessions with a collective cosmology around the topic of
  freedom, and what it meant for each of us: drawn outside, aspirations such as bodily autonomy,
  freedom of speech, mobility, access or being able to be oneself were met with the reality of the
  asylum system, where basic needs, represented in the core circles - such as residence permits,
  education or proper healthcare - are routinely neglected. In the empty spaces between aspiration
  and reality, we used the current support structures to cross through the circles and out onto the
  realm of aspiration: freedom. Reaching outwards, Trampoline House, anger, hope and resilience
  emerged as parallel lifelines in the cosmology. With its large empty areas representing the
  obstacles faced to reach safety and fulfil basic needs, let alone attain freedom, the ‘freedom’
  cosmology painted a very different picture from the original Cosmology of Care by Project Art
  Works, in which a maze-like social care system is visualised, appearing as illegible, but with a
  beginning, a middle, and an end. In other words, an adversarial system which can be navigated
  through finding - or building - the right support.

<p>
  Circulating beyond Trampoline House in Copenhagen, traces of the first series of workshops were
  part of the installations of both organisations in Kassel <strong>(Circle V)</strong>. Exhibited
  there, the cosmology drawings and blue portraits bore witness to the joint action that had taken
  place in our Copenhagen locality as we got together. Displaying traces as malleable indicators of
  both past and future action responds to shared values around the role of art and its place in
  exhibitions: as Project Art Works artist Tim Corrigan pointed out after the public workshop
  sessions, ‘the art is the conversation that takes place. It’s just that it’s done in a different
  way: artistic tools become conversation tools. Working this way, our practice becomes more
  collaborative, more immersive, more impulsive. The art, in other words, is the conversation. What
  is understood as ‘art’ - the painting, the film, the picture - becomes a trace, a tool, and a
  language.’<sup>3</sup> As he underlines, it is the activations of the space that are of utmost
  importance. Exhibition spaces work with, and are indebted to, the communities that activate and
  sustain them: they act as containers that amplify affective encounters through hosting their
  traces, thus forming new proposals for gathering and movement.
</p>

<p>
  The translation of our shared practices and conversations into the exhibition context of documenta
  in Kassel was both symbolic and literal. For Trampoline House, the feelings, testimonies and
  stories that were shared during the workshops with Project Art Works in May 2022 were important
  for rekindling a collective sense of self after a very hard year - the House had to close down in
  December 2021 due to economic struggles under COVID and had just reopened in a smaller version,
  the Weekend Trampoline House. Through harvesting these and other workshops in our locality, we
  were able to bring the voices of House members, who can’t travel outside of Denmark because of
  their legal status, into our installation in Kassel, both in film and in writing. Some of the
  testimonies from the workshops became central pieces of our documenta installation ‘Castle in
  Kassel’
  <strong
    >.(see, for example, Circle I - Kani’s Cosmology, with a transcript of the original installation
    video).</strong
  >.
</p>

<p>
  As for the cosmologies, which explored a different system to that of disability in the UK for the
  first time, the collaboration between Trampoline House and Project Art Works guided the public
  process of cosmology making during the 100 days of documenta, and it worked as a way to
  meaningfully broaden the topics explored by Project Art Works in Kassel. To mark the significance
  of our collaboration, symbolise translation into the local context of Kassel and pave the way for
  a process of public cosmology drawing sessions during the 100 days, a German translation of the
  Freedom cosmology was made and hung at the entrance of Project Art Works’ space in Fridericianum.
  As Kate Adams reflects on in her letter exchange with me and Sara Alberani, which is published in
  full in our harvest for visAvis:
</p>

<div class="t-quote">
  “Through workshops [at documenta], we had planned to draw Cosmologies of Care from around the
  world, hoping to find out how disabled people live, their communities and interdependencies. As it
  turned out, this was only partly achieved because so little is known about these parallel lives -
  unless through specific interest in or direct experience either of care systems or of disability
  and/or neurodivergence. [...] What did happen is that conversations radiated out into wider
  interrogations of the aspirations and lived experience of people in navigating oppressive systems
  of power. Our weekend of workshops with Trampoline House in ‘Massaging the Asylum System’ was a
  revelation in so many ways. The cosmologies captured testimonies from the Trampoline House
  communities, their experience of seeking asylum and safety within fortress Europe. Together we
  explored the concept of freedom, what this means to us all. The synergy across this incredibly
  diverse group was very moving and the resulting freedom cosmology formed an important entrance way
  into the Project Art Works space and our ongoing collaboration. It aligned strongly with the
  principles of Lumbung, of fairness, simplicity, interdependence and care”.<sup>4</sup>

<p>
  We took the learnings of Hastings and those of Copenhagen to Kassel and continued to work with the
  cosmologies: our public programme concluded with a collective exploration for imagining a better
  asylum system in a series of public workshops in Kassel involving documenta audiences
  <strong>(Circle VI)</strong>, which took place in September 2022 during the closing of the 100
  days of documenta.
</p>

<p>
  On the first day, in our Trampoline House space in Kassel, members from both teams and communities
  introduced the collaboration and set out to discuss the EU’s failing migration model while we made
  fresh portraits of each other. Meanwhile, we started to work on different cosmologies based on key
  aspects of participants’ experiences of community, belonging, migration and asylum. We also
  introduced audiences to some of the recommendations for a better asylum system coming from
  Trampoline House members who, because of their legal status, could not physically travel to
  Kassel, translating their voices and integrating them into the collective discussion and drawing
  process. People from the Project Art Works community, who could travel to Kassel, spontaneously
  engaged in participation, and some ended up vigorously reclaiming a better asylum system, much in
  the same way they’ve fought for better social care for years in their localities.

</div>

<p>
  On the second day, we moved to Project Art Works’ installation in the Fridericianum and we turned
  our individual cosmologies and collective discussions from day one into a final large-scale
  cosmology that sought to imagine asylum otherwise: merging together the recommendations from House
  members, asylum activists, immigration lawyers and migration researchers in Copenhagen,
  participants from both Trampoline House and Project Art Works, and the documenta audience, we sat
  together to collectively conceive a new model that can provide protection for everyone seeking
  safety in Europe. As Sara Alberani recalls in her letter to me and Kate Adams (see
  <strong>visÀvis</strong>
  harvest):
</p>

<div class="t-quote">
  “The Cosmologies practised by Kate within Project Art Works became the map of encounter between
  our own communities and visitors. Circles multiplied, everyone drew their own and crossed through
  others with their feet, a few straight lines marked common tangents and we could visualise what a
  better system of asylum and care means. An effort from the inside out. "Let the refugees be free
  inside the camps, let them work, let them make some money, let the kids go to the normal schools,
  not to asylum seeking schools. These kids are the future of tomorrow, why are we destroying their
  lives? Why are we killing them softly?" said Shakira Kasigwa Mukamusoni during the workshop
  'Massaging the Asylum System - Creative Strategies of Care' in Kassel.
</div>

<div class="t-quote">
  Being asylum seekers and feeling like impostors within a system that works better without one's
  presence, brings with it the anger accompanied by trauma and depression of those who see no
  future, and wait without knowing whether they will have the right to live, living under slow
  conditions of social death. [...] These words floated in a huge, collectively drawn cosmology that
  brought together, perhaps for the first time, asylum seekers, people with European passports,
  neurodivergent people and occasional documenta visitors who for many hours shared their valuable
  knowledge of systems of oppression and made an imaginative effort to figure out "how do we want to
  live?"<sup>5</sup>

  <span class="h3-number">3.</span>
  From ‘Where is the Art?’ to documenta fifteen: Navigating Systems of Care and Control in the
  Lumbung
</h3>

<p>
  When both collectives were invited to participate in documenta fifteen as Lumbung members, one of
  ruangrupa's statements was: 'Art is rooted in life. Instead of commissioning new art works, we
  asked artists and collectives to keep doing what they do in their localities while harvesting
  it'.2 One of the ways that we began building a relationship was the realisation that both of us
  were, literally, doing just that in our proposals to documenta: centring our localities,
  translating our practices into the exhibition space by summoning real lives and stories - bodies,
  emotions, trauma, and joy - but always in relationship to larger systems and their oppressions,
  and using art as a tool to create public conversations about hard topics: asylum and disability.
</p>

<p>
  Our artistic research began by a spontaneous process of alliance that was born out of the virtual
  Lumbung inter-lokal assemblies between the 14 core collectives - or Lumbung members - leading up
  to documenta fifteen, which were initiated online in late 2020, with Project Art Works joining in
  early 2021. The questions we posed and practised in the lumbung inter-lokal network during the
  months leading up to the exhibition informed our collaboration: What does it mean to be locally
  and globally rooted today, and what potential does locality currently hold? How can we share
  knowledge and resources among locales? How should our artistic practices use space to redefine our
  relationship with the public? How can we consider regenerative/collective economies? How can we
  translate our practices into the space of Kassel sustainably, generatively and non-extractively?
  All of these questions related directly to the overarching concept of the Lumbung, a communal rice
  barn where the <strong>surplus harvest</strong> is stored for the benefit of the community.
</p>

<p>
  Out of the different Lumbung groups that were created to get to know each other and develop
  thinking and practices around common interests, there was a particular space that became the base
  of the collaboration: the <strong>‘Where is the Art?’*</strong> Lumbung group, which both
  Trampoline House and Project Art Works joined. From the first conversations we exchanged, it
  became clear we both felt that this sarcastic question resonated with the way our practices were
  perceived, but also with our stance towards artistic practice - putting people before artworks. To
  quote artist Tania Bruguera, who had previously participated in Trampoline House’s artistic
  programme and was also part of lumbung through INSTAR, we shared the belief that ‘art should not
  be an event, but a culture of implementation’.3 During bi-weekly meetings, we began talking to one
  another around questions such as: What is art without objects? Which artwork can be an example in
  a way that can be tested in different cultures and localities? How do we make art in a place that
  doesn’t perceive this practice as art?
</p>

<div class="img-caption">

</div>

<p>
  The conversations we shared showed that this direct, caring way of working with community, where
  human rights are put in the centre, is central to both organisations. In this sense, the role of
  art as a tool to imagine reality otherwise, for reworlding, for rethinking relationships, beyond
  merely fixing, or maintaining, what the system has destroyed or discarded, is central to both
  Project Art Works and Trampoline House: there is a common appetite for dismantling established
  social models through the exercise of individual and collective agency and the intention to
  practise a set of divergent logics and tools in a sustained way.
</p>

<p>
  After a lot of informal dialogue among us, we were able to compare our practices, local contexts
  and the struggles of our communities in a public speaking session entitled
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sHlvXgKASg&t=3s&ab_channel=documentafifteen"
    >‘Navigating Systems of Care and Control’</a
  >, which took place online in April 2022. This conversation between Trampoline House and Project
  Art Works was part of Lumbung Konteks, an online public programme within documenta fifteen.
  Conceived as a monthly conversation series between pairs of lumbung members in the period leading
  up to the exhibition, this initiative from the documenta Artistic Team sought to create dialogues
  among the different collectives, drawing common threads in our practice that reflected on shared
  lumbung values. In the case of Trampoline House and Project Art Works, we already had a clear
  sense of what our common ground was, and we seized the public programme as an opportunity to share
  our artistic practices, concerns and political agendas, laying the groundwork for the
  collaboration that was to come.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  Moderated by Yasmin Gunaratnam, a British scholar who has been working on issues of race and
  gender equality in health and social care for the past twenty years, ‘Navigating Systems of Care
  and Control’ was important for two main reasons. First, it allowed us to recognise the
  <strong>similarities</strong> in the struggles that our communities face, such as invisibility in
  society, infantilisation and lack of agency, marginalisation, institutionalisation, punitive
  attitudes towards challenging behaviour, and societal neglect, to name a few. In recognising the
  similarities in the struggles that our communities face, we could also identify a similar use of
  artistic practices in both organisations: as creative tools for activism. Using different
  strategies, we both work to make visible the shared knowledge that there is no such thing as a
  ‘homogenous’ group of ‘refugees’ or ‘disabled people’. For this reason, placing individual needs
  and people’s lived experience and knowledge of their situation at the centre of activism, advocacy
  and social inclusion work is key. In the conversation, it became clear that our work entails a
  similar understanding of vulnerability as system-produced, as well as an awareness that
  interdependency and reliance upon social systems of care is a reality that surrounds us all, and a
  condition which should be reclaimed in a caring, emancipatory way, rather than aspiring to the
  Western ideal of total ‘autonomy’ and individual success, which is fuelled by an exploitative
  capitalist system.
</p>

<p>
  In our exchange, very clear parallels emerged, especially regarding the way that our communities -
  neurodivergent people and refugees - are treated as improductive bodies or
  <strong>‘surplus’</strong> in society - to borrow a term from the book Health Communism,4 which
  mentions both the asylum system and disabled communities as specific government-managed
  carceral-socio-medical systems of ‘care’ that produce profitable marginalisation through
  discipline and systemic/legal processes of categorisation that make people vulnerable.5 Concepts
  such as ‘social murder’ (Engels), ‘slow death’ (Lauren Berlant) ‘social death’ (Orlando
  Patterson/Nicholas Mirzoeff), ‘bare life’ (Giorgio Agamben), or ‘the chain’ (Shakira Kasigwa
  Mukamusoni-Trampoline House) illustrate the ways in which care is exercised as control upon
  certain collectives deemed ‘undesirable’ inside Western capitalist societies. It is the ‘slow
  violence of the everyday’, as Lauren Berlant puts it, through which our governments’ necropolitics
  allow for the dire subsistence of marginalised bodies.
</p>

<p>
  Navigating both the asylum system in Denmark and social care systems in the UK, it is easy to get
  stuck in places where the body might be fed and cared for, but the spirit is left to waste. For
  instance, in Sjaelsmark, a remote Danish camp for rejected asylum seekers which we visited upon
  invitation by fellow Trampoline House Artistic Team member Christine,6 people live in bare rooms
  that resemble prison cells with random roommates, they can’t decorate their rooms or cook their
  own food, they describe the food that they have to eat as ‘inedible’, and every night, they are
  locked in every day at 10 pm. This situation bears a clear resemblance to practices of
  institutionalisation in the modern history of disability in the West, where current plans for the
  modernisation of care often fall short of people’s needs and expectations. For example, according
  to scholar Jill Bradshaw, despite the changes from institutionalised to communal living for
  learning disabled people in the UK, which are part of a larger strategy for the individualisation
  of care based on catering for a person’s specific needs, ‘it is of course possible to transfer
  many of the negative features of institutional living to life in a community house: rigid
  routines, lack of choice, little opportunity to participate in activities both in and out of the
  home, no control over where you live or with whom, limited contact with the wider community…
  <sup>8</sup> In other words, despite some progress, invisibility and dehumanisation are still
  recurrent realities in social care. This might also be partly due to the fact that, like in the
  rest of Europe, social care services in the UK have suffered a comprehensive process of
  devaluation, de-funding and privatisation in the last decades.<sup>9</sup>
</p>

<p>
  Second, Navigating Systems of Care and Control allowed us to recognise the
  <strong>differences</strong> in our communities, but also in our organisations. For example, we
  saw clear differences in the type and levels of support that people may need throughout their
  lives and thus, the kinds of vulnerabilisation via disabling tactics that are enacted by the
  system. People with complex support needs are system and care-dependent, which typically allows
  institutions to dictate the standardised pathways that they must follow, often with an emphasis on
  what they cannot do; refugees are made deliberately system-dependent by being surveilled, locked
  away and banned from education and working, preventing them from doing things as a control
  strategy. While in Denmark this responds to a deliberate government strategy to make people’s
  mental health waste away in camps over the years, thus deterring them from seeking asylum - a
  tactic that Nicholas Mirzoeff termed ‘social death’ during his collaboration with Trampoline
  House,<sup>7</sup> in the UK we find that dehumanisation can still be a consequence of de-funded,
  still partly inadequate social care. We also looked at the different levels of social antagonism
  to either community, and consequently, the different levels of government support that are offered
  to either cause and organisation. Here, the criminalisation of refugees in Europe stood out
  against disability, the latter being an easier topic to navigate at present, within both public
  and private funding structures. In this landscape, we reflected on the recent financial struggles
  of Trampoline House, whose activist work is centred upon rejected asylum seekers and frontally
  opposes the dismal government policies in place, having taken its activist work up to the Danish
  Parliament. In this sense, the analysis of our differences as arts organisations threw light on
  the ways in which the social and political issues of our time are increasingly dealt with through
  progressive artistic infrastructures, and the consequences that this shift might have on societal
  approaches towards certain social groups, but also on the level of solidity, stability, funding,
  and coverage of pressing social and political issues.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Navigating Systems of Care and Control’ exposed a shared perspective on the ways in which our
  communities are embedded within infrastructures of <strong> care and control</strong> , which
  allowed us to reflect on how the capitalist organisation of care produces and reproduces our
  societies’ necropolitical assumptions. As Pascale Molinier writes, ‘care is the neuralgic conflict
  zone’.<sup>10</sup> What is saved and what is not, on whom the burden of care work falls and on
  whom it does not, who is allowed to provide care for others and who remains a victim, who lives
  and who only affords to survive, who can be an artist and who cannot, are decisions at the heart
  of every society, historically formalised by different models of care labour organisation.<sup
    >11</sup
  >
  As a consequence of that, social systems of care, which are often adversarial, hard to navigate,
  and have deteriorated enormously in the last decades, often fail to detect, let alone tend to an
  individual’s human needs and aspirations. Because the vulnerability of our communities appears to
  be, to a large extent, system fabricated, it becomes a field of intervention:
  <strong> care and control</strong>
  emerge as a shifting dichotomy, causing our work to move between two poles: from lack (of proper
  care) and experience (of being controlled) to freedom to (care)/freedom from (control). This
  duality is represented in the cosmologies, where freedom emerges first as speculative futurity,
  and eventually as a potentially tangible outcome: a better asylum system. At the same time, the
  duality of the term ‘surplus’ as a historically oppressive notion to define ‘improductive
  populations’ versus ruangrupa’s proposal - a generative energy for the community - emerges clearly
  in our collaboration, where the latter is practised intently, alongside our individual agendas,
  and with communities at the forefront that are marginalised in different, yet touching ways.

  Caring Action, Intersections (and Limitations), Friendship: Some Conclusions
</h3>

<p>
  In the collaboration process, frictions and antagonisms also emerged, from Trampoline House
  members feeling a lack of connection with what was perceived as a white, ‘foreign body’, to
  antagonising positions adopted by some people - especially young, educated men with refugee
  backgrounds - for whom joint action seemed to imply an equation of both communities. In other
  words, the fear of being equated with what they perceived as a weaker Other - and thus
  re-marginalised - emerged in parts of the process, attesting to the reality that self-perceived
  hierarchies also exist within different marginalised groups, particularly in regards to gender,
  class or ability. In these moments, it was always important to keep language accessible, to be
  very transparent, and to speak from our situated positions, privileges and differences, so as to
  invite non-judgemental openness and mutual understanding.
</p>

<p>
  These intersections had other limitations: it is not coincidental that, to our knowledge, there
  are practically no openly disabled or neurodivergent people who are members of Trampoline House.
  From the start, Project Art Works were curious about the presence of these communities in the
  House. As we concluded, people with disabilities, old age and complex support needs in the asylum
  system are kept in camps in Jutland (another island three hours north-west of Copenhagen) in
  conditions of severe isolation - and that is if they make it to Denmark at all, as disabled people
  are much less likely to migrate in the first place.<sup>12</sup> Sadly, through the years,
  Trampoline House has not had the means to bring people from Jutland into the House, as a result of
  added economic difficulty to engage people who need specific care and support. In the individual
  cases of House members where disability is a result of the trauma suffered during the migration
  journey - sadly, a common reality for many people - we didn’t find an appropriate means to discuss
  the topic in a way that the story could move from the personal to the systemic without exposing
  the person. In other words, we didn't want to force the intersection of these two realities by
  concentrating on individual stories. Instead, we chose to focus on establishing parallels between
  our communities, coming together, and translating aspects of Project Art Works’ methodology into
  the House dynamics to read the asylum system together and focus on creating solidarity through the
  joint act of ‘massaging’.
</p>

<p>
  Caring, in this context, means struggling, devoting energy and time to transform unequal power
  relations.<sup>13</sup> It also means appropriating toxic terrain, a field of domination; making
  it capable of nurturing again.<sup>6</sup> In this sense, I think it’s important to understand
  shortcomings not as a tragedy, but as opportunities for reflection. Accepting the partial
  transformative power of caring practices is reading these experimentations as material struggles
  that ask us to “stay in touch with the problem”, as Donna Haraway states. In other words: when
  rehearsing critical caring tools, we shouldn’t place ourselves in a scenario of wrong vs right.
  Rather, we can ask ourselves: what can we do differently next time? How can we engage people
  better? How can we be more consistent? How can we create alliances without making people feel that
  their identities are alienated or without making them feel like their differences are threatened?
  But also - how can we question hierarchies of oppression carefully and not be blind to the ways in
  which oppressions do intersect and operate, in an attempt to remain faithful to our communities?
</p>

<p>
  While documenta fifteen is over, our practice and friendship is not. As we continue to harvest the
  fruits of our work in various ways, our encounters have already given birth to new alliances and
  relationships, in the form of translocally informed, locally rooted projects that use art to raise
  awareness and create alliances between different marginalised groups. At a time of deep political
  unrest in our various locales, we also simply seek to preserve the community bonds we created
  through writing, talking, and sharing work, time and physical space when possible.
</p>

<p>
  Reflecting on our collaboration and ‘temporary coalition’, as I have called it before, researcher
  Anne K. Petersen recently wrote that we had ’[taken] art’s visual and political agency seriously,
  casting imagination and its visual materializations as a potential ‘strong card’ in transformative
  politics.’<sup>14</sup> Perhaps that is true. One thing is for sure, and that is the feeling of a
  jointly lived experience. Throughout the 100 days, we were in one another’s spaces, events, and
  things, drew new cosmologies, took portraits and developed solar prints, rushed through production
  lists, presented our collaboration in public events in Kassel with a collective sense of unease
  and vulnerability as we stepped out of our respective comfort zones, shared dinners and printers
  that got lost in mystery Kassel production departments, went dancing after hours to raves and sat
  by beautiful lakes in Kassel to see the sunrise. Together, we experienced documenta fifteen as a
  bittersweet experience of censorship, of joy and tears, of togetherness and separation, sharing a
  sense of direction and survival in the face of hardship and the constant threat of closure over
  the summer of 2022, while proposing radically different forms of embodying artistic practice and
  being in an exhibition space - and most importantly, beyond it. Ultimately, our process allowed us
  to learn to question, from a new angle, who art is for and what it is for.
</p>

<p>
  I would like to close this essay with a citation from the letter that I recently wrote to Sara and
  Kate - my two colleagues and friends - on the subject of our collaboration:
</p>

<div class="t-quote">
  ‘Looking back on our joint venture, I am reminded of Product of Circumstances, where writer Xavier
  Leroy talks about ‘lateral space’. Lateral space, he argues, shows us that value is usually to be
  found in what lies next to the thing we were initially looking for, rather than in the thing
  itself. I think that Massaging the Asylum System is a perfect example of the ways in which
  friendship, curiosity and courage contaminated our initial political and artistic agendas and the
  rehearsed, successful formulas we’ve had to come up with to survive in capitalist systems of
  funding, generating an honest, lateral space’.<sup>7</sup>

<h3>Epilogue. On Trampoline House & Project Art Works at documenta fifteen</h3>

<p>
  Though very different in aesthetic, character and scope, our proposals for documenta fifteen also
  had something in common: our installations and their public activations were thoughtful
  propositions where art was a vehicle for having difficult conversations about the lives of our
  communities. These were told in the collective first person, placed within the larger framework of
  human rights, and situating agency and direct action as a focus point.
</p>

<p>
  Located in the Hübner building, <strong>Trampoline House’s Castle</strong> in Kassel consisted of
  a cosy, Scandinavian-style living room set up inside a chalk circle - a weak, imaginary
  construction that demarcated the house as a protected space, decidedly yet precariously shielding
  people from the hostility facing migrants in Denmark.

<p>
  On the outside: a wall, reading - THIS IS WHAT YOU FACE WHEN SEEKING ASYLUM IN DENMARK - listed an
  endless trail of dehumanising protocols by the Danish government, while the combination of space
  and artworks - film and sound pieces, animation, a visit book where visitors could write and share
  their thoughts and feelings, zines, a fashion collection, masks, protest signs - invited the
  viewer to walk around, sit down, read and watch TV and come into contact and direct empathy with
  the reality of Danish - and by extension European - migration policies and their impact on
  people’s dignity. Making visible the fact that our wider community could not be physically present
  in Kassel because of their legal status, our Artistic Team, made up of 14 people with mixed
  refugee and non-refugee backgrounds, put together a programme for the 100 days. We chose to focus
  on very different site activations: a fashion show, public talks, poetry readings, public drawing
  sessions and performances on the migrant question and its political and ethical underpinnings,
  always placing migrant and refugee knowledge, embodiment and experience at the centre, referring
  back to the House for feedback and inviting what we call ‘deprogramming’ - a collective
  questioning of one’s own assumptions, privileges and positions through shared vulnerability and
  affect in the space of the House, whose spirit we had aimed to translate into our living room at
  Hübner.
</p>

<p>
  For its part, <strong>Project Art Works’</strong> supported studio practice for neurodivergent and
  disabled artists, which spans 20 years, radiated out of the Fridericianum into multiple sites
  across the city, along with collaborations with audiences, carers, neurodivergent people, and
  artists. Their main installation space in the Fridericianum was a direct proposition to have a
  conversation around disability, neurodivergence and complex needs through the coming together of
  three main elements: the open archive - artworks & film - of artists from the Project Art Works
  collective in Hastings; the Cosmologies of Care, with public drawing sessions and circles
  progressively filling up the space with stories of people, carers and communities, and an
  immersive workshop set-up that worked as a reminder of Project Art Works’ core engagement with
  neurodivergent people through building relationships and sustained supported studio practice. In
  the space, translations of the cosmologies from our joint workshops in Copenhagen also emerged
  over the weeks, speaking about freedom to German-speaking audiences in their mother tongue.

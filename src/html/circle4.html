    I’ve lived in refugee camps for seven years. The meaning of freedom when I lived in that

    ‘What is really interesting about the camp cosmology we made is that whereas in the original
    ones for the UK system there is a maze of bureaucracy and institutions, in the freedom cosmology
    everything stays in the first circles, and there are a lot of voids. And you can see that’s
    because basic human needs have been denied.

  The workshop ‘Massaging the Asylum System’ is a collaboration between Trampoline House and Project
  Art Works, a collective of neurodiverse artists based in the UK and it is curated by Sara Alberani
  and Carlota Mir as part of the participation of TH and PAW in documenta fifteen.

<div class="t-piece-text" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif">
  Together, we want to explore the relationship between our community, people’s needs as they seek
  asylum and try to rebuild their lives in Denmark, and how different systems, from the state to
  Danish society, may or may not support these needs. We will also look at Trampoline House, what
  the house does with people, and what the asylum system should learn from the house.
</div>

<div class="t-piece-text" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif">
  Through shared time and creative action, we will massage the asylum system - yes, massage, like a
  real massage - so that it can become softer and more humane. Through spending time together and
  using some tools like drawing or writing, we will get a really useful picture of the asylum system
  that comes from everyone’s experiences. Using this shared knowledge, we will be able to think
  about ways to understand and stand in the system, to challenge it, to channel anger, to feel less
  vulnerable and alone, to be heard in it, and eventually, to change it.
</div>

<div class="t-piece-text" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif">
  The asylum system in Denmark is like a “chain” that means to be stuck in a legal grey zone,
  neither detained nor free, and without prospects of pursuing a future life in Denmark or in
  Europe. The chain is the structurally violent exhaustion strategy.
</div>

<div class="t-piece-text" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif">
  This system works on creating sad emotions, sad feelings, this is essential to the exercise of
  power. And the rage is a consequence of that. It separates from the capacity to act. It doesn’t
  depend on the will or even on personal faculties, we know that. It is linked to the conditions of
  oppression in society. Positive feelings coming from relationships, joy, creative work, access to
  social life, therefore have to do with the possibility of acting. So, what are the creative
  processes that someone can adopt to face a violent system? We want to be creative towards the
  system, connecting the bodies to one’s ability to act.

  The workshop is an adaptation of Cosmologies of Care, a method that Project Artworks has been
  working with for some time. Project Art Works and Trampoline House are collaborating partners in
  documenta fifteen, an international art exhibition that takes place in Kassel, Germany, in the
  summer of 2022.

<div class="t-piece-text" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif">
  We are working together because we think that our communities have things to talk about: because
  often, the State doesn’t care about the wellbeing of our communities, and people in our
  communities have a really hard time accessing public spaces in society. We hope that by sharing
  the stories of our communities and their struggles in the world, we will be able to make an
  impact.

  <div>About Project Art Works</div>
  <div>
    Project Art Works is a collective of neurodiverse artists and activists that works with art and
    care. They are based in Hastings, UK. They are a very diverse group of artists who see the world
    differently to what society thinks is ‘normal’. Like Trampoline House in Denmark and its work
    for refugee justice, Project Artworks uses art to provide support and public access for
    neurodiverse people, raise awareness and change the care system in the UK.

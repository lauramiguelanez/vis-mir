    3’ 10’’: ‘Themes of <strong>hospitality</strong> and <strong>care</strong> are central to
    documenta fifteen.[...] The purpose of these conversations is really to share and to listen and
    to learn, but also to expand and challenge how we might think about the ethical and the
    political tightrope that <strong>bridges the meeting points between care and control</strong>,
    and not only at the level of the State but also within the most intimate levels of our
    relationships in working towards and perhaps rehearsing more radical communities of care and
    hospitality that are convened by art’. <strong>Yasmin Gunaratnam</strong>

    8’ 36’’. First of all, apologies that Shakira cannot be here. Shakira Mukamusoni is an activist
    that has been working for several years inside of the Trampoline House community and a
    <strong>vital voice</strong> inside it. [...] She's originally from Congo and she has
    experienced the worst of the Danish asylum system. [...] Shakira is currently doing important
    research for our documenta project in the <strong>camps</strong> - in Amstrup concretely - and
    the connection is really bad there, so sadly, it just has not been possible [to get her online].
    We think it's important to show this absence [onscreen] because it's really also part of our
    community’s presence in documenta fifteen: people cannot travel, they cannot access reliable
    connection and they are faced with really dire <strong>material conditions</strong>.

    12’ 52’’. Trampoline House is a way to take action, to propose that there is a different way.
    <strong>Trampoline House is not helping people</strong>: we try to give people the tools,
    knowledge and information so they can <strong>help themselves</strong> in this
    <strong>vulnerable situation</strong> that they’re in. We do that by offering job training and
    internships, legal counselling, medical counselling, psychological counselling, language
    classes, workshops, art exhibitions, democratic fora, community dinners, and socialising.

    14’ 45’’. If you want to promote democracy, you have to <strong>deprogram</strong> yourself: you
    have to get to a point where you can meet on equal terms. That's not easy because the inequality
    between the <strong>asylum system</strong> and a general <strong>citizen</strong> in Denmark is
    immense - but this <strong>house is creating a social frame</strong> where it is possible to
    feel equality.

    22’38’’. We have quite an expensive system for asylum seekers, but the problem is that it is
    used to isolate people, so people are being put in these camps and they’re being victimised. It
    doesn't mean that they starve or have no roof over their heads - on the contrary, their
    <strong>bodies</strong> are taken <strong>care</strong> of. There's also a healthcare system,
    although it's lower quality <strong>healthcare</strong> in comparison with their Danish system
    but still, the system respects the human body, but it doesn't respect the
    <strong>individual as a citizen</strong>, or anything like that. <strong>MG</strong>

    1h 01’ 00’ - <strong> ‘The chain’</strong>  means to be stuck in a grey area: <strong
      >neither detained nor free</strong
    >
    , without a perspective of a future. This happens in Denmark but also in Europe. So what does it
    mean? It is about creating a structurally violent exhaustion strategythat provokes a lot of
    emotions and feelings. We started the conversation with Project Art Works thinking about that:
    how to face emotions like rage, frustration or exhaustion inside very normative systems? Power
    structures work to create <strong>sad emotions, sad feelings</strong>. This is really essential
    to the exercise of power, and the rage is a consequence of that. That is the daily mechanism of
    the chain. It separates people from the capacity to act, it separates people from each other and
    it stops them from having access to public and social life. This is linked to the conditions of
    an oppressive society, so what we are also trying to do is <strong
      >create positive emotions, affect, and personal relationships and really to shape this space
      through that</strong
    >, so that we have access to a space that be transformed by the actions that we are doing. Tone,
    when speaking with Project Art Works, she was talking about ‘massaging’ the system: so, not
    tackling the system from a direct perspective but trying to carve out the creative ways in which
    we can really have the possibility to act  through our bodies, through our relationships. I
    think this is really important inside the chain as a symbolic structure. <strong

    1h 17’ 14’’Usually after six months a lot of the people who live in the camp system go sick.
    They become sick. It’s the illness of being isolated and most of them have levels of depression.
    Then the response from this healthcare system in the camps is to start
    <strong>medicating</strong> people. And we think that's an utterly wrong approach, because
    actually what happens in the camps is that
    <strong>people react in a healthy way to a sick system</strong>. And that's really why our
    response at <strong>Trampoline House</strong> is an
    <strong>antidote to this system that makes people ill</strong>: we offer people to become part
    of the community, which they have no way of being part of otherwise.

    30’ 55’’. [At Project Art Works], we use art to enable people to be <strong>visible</strong> and
    to be creative <strong>on their own terms</strong> in ways that completely resonate with their
    innate ability and ways of interacting with the world. Kate Adams, The context at the moment is
    that for example, in the last two years, two-thirds of the people who've
    <strong>died</strong> in the UK through the pandemic are <strong>disabled</strong>, and people
    requiring support in all areas of their life, so there's a profound <strong>inequity</strong> in
    society between neurodivergent and non-neurodivergent communities or disabled and non-disabled
    communities. In this sense, it's very important to create a platform of visibility that is
    recognizable as a place of <strong>value</strong>. And in our society.
    <strong>culture is valued</strong>.

    34’ 44’’ ‘The term <strong>non-verbal</strong> [inside the neurodivergent spectrum] is very
    important in terms of how we think about the contemporary
    <strong>conditions of citizenship</strong>. I think you're [both] working in different domains
    of what I would think of as <strong>‘intimate citizenship’</strong>. So how do we honour
    people's different forms of agency within a wider <strong>system</strong> that can be
    <strong>dehumanizing</strong>?

    The difficulties for people in the practical solutions to living and receiving the support that
    they need are very central to [PAW’s] work. We operate in a system where we do have
    <strong>systemic structures</strong> that can provide <strong>support</strong>, but they tend to
    be very adversarial. So, for someone who needs support in all areas of their life - they aren't
    actually innately vulnerable in themselves, they're
    <strong>made vulnerable by adversarial systems</strong> which tend to be discretionary
    especially as adults - so the art in the studios it has no boundaries: it operates on the basis
    of <strong>fixing environments and not people</strong>, so the environment we create enables
    freedom, which then enables a person to flower and to be free and to respond and to lead the
    development of a practice, whatever that might be. That then creates a real sense of value and
    agency for the individual, which then radiates radiates out to the family, and I think that
    that's a really important aspect because it <strong>repositions</strong> someone as
    <strong>not an object of need</strong> and of risk and of assessment and of services and of
    public funds, but as an extremely <strong>vital creative force</strong>. KA, 43’ 44’’

    48’00’’ There's this idea that society and culture here are open and liberal and accessible, but
    one of the things for us is how <strong>invisible</strong> people are in communities in civic
    and community life, in leadership in
    <strong>[Carl makes noise in the background]</strong> programs of culture and exhibitions. And
    we've tried very gently to challenge these things, because there's a lot of fear in society - I
    think - <strong>about difference</strong>. <strong>KA</strong>
  </div>

  <div class="ext-txt">
    <div class="mark"></div>
    53’00’’ [In social systems] Care means a lack of care, actually. I think that there's been such
    an overuse actually of the term care recently, especially in the art world, in cultural
    contexts, etc, but I think it's really important to remember that especially for our
    communities, <strong>care is a really ambiguous word</strong> and it's loaded with
    <strong>tension</strong>, because conventional structures of care and State structures… I mean,
    I think that people in our community are <strong>allergic</strong> to them, because to them care
    is means of top-down control, means victimisation, means infantilizing, means debilitating. So I
    don't think that this necessarily means that we should abandon the word though. I think what
    Trampoline House does is to confront that through <strong>working with care</strong> as a way of
    working with a system that's already <strong>toxic</strong>, and trying to reverse that.
    [...]For instance, if somebody is a French teacher then they can teach [French in the house]or
    they do maintenance tasks [...] but it's really about having a <strong>space</strong> that
    enables <strong>public access</strong> and <strong>care giving</strong> as a pre-establishment
    of a social democratic contract [of citizenship, of rights and obligations] which is suspended
    in the case of asylum seekers for many many years.

    54’ 16’’ The concept of <strong>the chain</strong> comes from the fact that you know we
    [refugees and asylum seekers] we just keep circling in a loop, and everything just keeps
    repeating itself, you know like if you like also […] in terms of like sustaining people's bodies
    but at the same time the system strips people out from their humanity and from their
    individuality uh because when you are a rejected asylum seeker in Denmark you just have no
    access or no right to to basically anything. You can just
    <strong>sleep and eat and breathe, and that’s all of your rights</strong>.

    1: 02’ 40’’ [Thinking about the element of voice in Project Art Works] and particularly the
    acoustic um elements that you can hear now
    <strong>[Carl making noises with his voice in the background]</strong>
    [...] I wonder if you wanted to say something [...] about
    <strong>words literally slipping through the fingers</strong> - so all the
    <strong>things that we can't represent</strong>, and perhaps looking at measuring your worth and
    the importance of that. <strong>YG</strong>

    1h 04’31’’. Language and words are sort of redefined within the kind of studio in many ways,
    because <strong>the art making becomes this shared language</strong> between people. [..] Some
    people make work in a very very autonomous way and have this incredible relationship with
    materials, and other people make work in a very instinctive way, and with other people it's very
    collaborative, and actually [Through] the use of materials and art making practice [...] this
    <strong>language is created between people</strong>, which creates these kind of relationships,
    and yeah there's obviously a lot of fun in that exploration and of kind of redefining the
    parameters of what a relationship can be and how we communicate with each other. [...] So much
    of the work [both artworks and films] is the trace of this activity, this conversation might not
    even be recognized by the maker as something to keep - it just is a trace of this engagement.

  <div class="ext-txt">
    <div class="mark"></div>
    1h 07’07’’ Yeah, and also it creates a layer of insight for audiences if they have this thing on
    the wall that looks like a work of art, and it may well be a work of art it depends how you feel
    about it. But it is this recognizable object, and then there is a greater, much more sensitive
    and deeper insight into the origination of that object on the wall. And sometimes that can both
    inspire audiences, or it can actually disturb them interestingly, because it plays with ideas of
    value - fundamental cultural and human value. It's one of the reasons why…
    <strong>[Carl shouting in the background]</strong> I think that's what Carl wants to say on that
    issue! - It is one of the reasons why it's so important to have [the artists] in public
    exhibition spaces,[...] and also be visible. This also causes, very often, complex responses in
    people, because there's still an idea that if
    <strong>someone doesn't use language to communicate, then they don't have agency</strong>. [...]
    if people don't use the learnt modes of social interaction and communication, then they are
    <strong>threatening to a civic understanding</strong> of what it is to be human, and to be able
    to contribute. <strong>KA</strong>
  </div>

  <div class="ext-txt">
    <div class="mark"></div>
    1h 23’ 30’’ I think it's exactly this: it's the fact that we [at Trampoline House] make unique
    support structures that wouldn't otherwise exist that really makes the art, and I think that is
    something that I can also see um at work in the practice of Project Art Works - so the idea of
    having an environment that over time becomes a structure, and it becomes a model perhaps of
    doing things differently. <strong>CM</strong>

    Morten Goll (Trampoline House) and Tim Corrigan (Project Art Works). Transcript: Carlota Mir
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-intro">Zoom - 1 April 2022</div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    MG: Trampoline House and Project Art Works both work with the idea of multiple identities, which
    are used to carry the authorship. We want to challenge authorship.
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    TC: Yes! Also, we both want to work for the most vulnerable people, and include them. People are
    not inherently vulnerable, but made vulnerable by social systems.
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    MG: Who does documenta fifteen benefit? Does it actually benefit our communities, or does it
    benefit the art world?
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">TC: That’s a difficult one… It’s quite ambiguous, isn’t it?</div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    MG: I think what we can say is that we are using Lumbung to question documenta fifteen from the
    inside.
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    TC: Project Art Works works between the glamorous art world and the deeply unglamourous world of
    social care, and there is a clear relationship with Trampoline House in this sense. The personal
    is political.
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    MG: Ah, care… Care is overused in artspeak. With asylum seekers, care focuses on the body, but
    everything else is uncared for and neglected on purpose. At Trampoline House, we’re really bad
    at artspeak. We have our own language: we speak Trampoline House English. This English comes
    from the camps, where people teach themselves English. But Project Art Works do need care in
    their communities.
  </div>
  <div class="t-notes-el">
    TC: They do,they need care - but what we do is create supported environments where people can be
    themselves - that is the opposite of the usual power dynamic in care settings.
  </div>
</div>

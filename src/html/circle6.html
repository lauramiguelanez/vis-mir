<h1>
  Massaging the Asylum System, Creative Strategies of Care<span class="foot-label">1</span>
  A Joint Workshop by Project Art Works and Trampoline House: Copenhagen’s Refugee Justice Community
  Centre
</h1>

<div class="t-script">
  <div>Friday, September 23, 12–4 pm at Trampoline House’s space in the Hübner venue</div>
  <div>
    During the first day of the workshop, we will convene in Trampoline House’s exhibition space in
    the Hübner venue in Kassel to discuss the EU’s failing migration model and make different
    ‘cosmologies of care’ based on key aspects of participants’ experiences of citizenship,
    belonging, community, migration and asylum. We will end with speculations for a new model that
    can provide protection for everyone seeking safety in Europe.

  <div>
    On the second day, we will move to Project Art Works’ installation in the Fridericianum and work
    together with Project Art Works artists, participants and audiences to imagine asylum through a
    final drawing within the cosmologies of care installation that has been evolving over the 100
    days of documenta 15. We will also use a series of recommendations for a better and more humane
    refugee policy in Denmark from a group of Trampoline House members with flight experience,
    developed together with a group of immigration lawyers, migration researchers, and asylum
    activists in an internal workshop in the house in September 2022.

<p>Listen to Sara Alberani reflect on this day here:</p>

    We’re all slightly jittery and uncomfortable. A circle made of empty chairs inside our chalk
    circle signals it is open for people to join. There is Tone, Shakira, Sara, me - the women from
    Trampoline - and there is Anna, Helen, Martin, and Tim from Project Art Works. Annis and Sara
    will join us in a while if they can - as there’s another big Project Art Works workshop going on
    in their Stadtmuseum space all morning and they have to run it - even though they’d love to be
    with us.

    Kate couldn’t join us this time, as she’s had to stay in the UK to take care of a loved one and
    provide chemo treatment support. The news that Kate couldn’t make it to Kassel for the documenta
    finissage and our last workshops came late and were pretty hard on her but also on all of us -
    obviously, we had all been looking forward to sharing this time together, but not only that: the
    Cosmologies are diagrams that were born out of Kate’s life, out of a vision for herself, her
    family and her son. Somehow, running the workshop without her is both an act of trust and a leap
    of faith on her part, and a big responsibility for the rest of us. In the May workshops, she
    came to us with her methods and her art, together with other PAW artists and other creative,
    collective methods from the House to talk about asylum, people, freedom, build relationships and
    create something bigger than the sum of its parts. This time though, the artist herself is
    absent, which means that we will be lacking her pretty handwriting on the concentric circles,
    and a reference point in the room. Suddenly, the cameraman will have to become a mediator, the
    curators artists, the activists presenters, the project manager a facilitator, the artists
    chefs, and the audience activists and artists. I can see some colleagues who are not used to
    speaking in public pacing around the room reading and memorising scripts, looking terrified.
  </p>
  <p class="t-body">
    As Sara has written down in her notebook for the day, the question we had before September was:
    ‘how to inhabit an exhibition space? How do we interact with our communities and documenta
    audiences in a meaningful way? How can we translate processes that have been born and developed
    inside specific emotional and physical spaces into the context of a mass-scale exhibition like
    documenta? In short, how do we translate, and not extract?’ With Kate’s absence, which adds up
    to an absence we already knew we would have to work with - that of the people from the house,
    who have all the knowledge and the experience to ignite Kassel, but they can’t leave the country
    - the translation of our joint endeavour into the exhibition space is a double challenge: not
    only do we have to translate people’s voices and concerns into the exhibition space - for that,
    we have video, we have a manifesto for a better asylum system that Tone put together with a
    group of house users, activists and lawyers in August, and we have Shakira and her son, with
    their refugee experience, her powerful presence and her piercing voice, along with whomever else
    might join us today. Now, we also have to translate the cosmologies - a methodology that is
    collective but that stems from an artists life and craft - into a totally collective enterprise.
    Will audiences understand that we couldn’t bring our people to Kassel, and also, that we didn’t
    want to necessarily exchange a group of local refugees for Trampoline House users, because this
    space isn’t a house? Rather, we wanted the experience of the people in Denmark to be a guiding
    reference for people to build on, welcoming and informally inviting people with refugee
    experience to the workshops - but we did not want to act as if groups of people are
    interchangeable. That has been a constant in our 100 days, and something we’re proud of, despite
    challenges from the Artistic Team and our own self-doubt. We need to reach Kassel publics and
    get the message across, and these are tools that we have: ourselves, people’s voice, and each
    other.

    Last night, we all had dinner together - the TH team and the PAW team and some of their artists
    and their families, who had travelled all the way from Hastings for the finissage. We had
    ambitious plans to have a fancy dinner somewhere but, in the end, being over twenty people and
    having different schedules, energy levels, budgets, and dietary requirements - and also having
    to go through our two-day schedule last minute, as it always happens - we ended up having dinner
    just before midnight in the dark, carpeted lobby of the Hotel Hessenland, under the slightly
    surprised, welcoming gaze of the two rather quirky receptionists who had been taking care of us
    for the entire week. As it was so late in the end, we ended up sharing some bits and bobs of
    Thai food the only organised people in the PAW community - parents with cars, of course - had
    got hold of. Obviously, it wasn’t enough, so Anna’s mum - who had driven all the way from
    England to Kassel and therefore had her car there with her - offered to drive back out to the
    only open Thai restaurant in the city to get food for the rest of us. Eventually, her and Anna
    came back with a beautiful set of Anna’s tin lunch boxes, filled with deliciously hot Thai food.
    Accompanied by a generous helping of chips from Lidl and some supermarket wine, dinner was more
    than enough - it felt like a hug.
  </p>
  <p class="t-body">
    After dinner, our core teams get to work. I was very happy to see Anna so involved in the
    workshop and the topic of asylum. She shared a reference with Shakira: Wendy Ewald, American
    artist who has been working with refugees in Calais. Shakira said she’d look it up. They make a
    shopping list: they will be cooking together to make lunch for everyone tomorrow. It’s
    vegetarian, and Anna shows meticulous care and interest in choosing ingredients, making sure
    that everybody can eat, whatever their requirements. Shakira and Anna only met this week, but
    I’m delighted to see their complicity radiate out to the table. Anna compliments Shakira’s rich
    English, and Shakira explains how she basically learned it in the camps to survive, because she
    had to spend ten years there. Camp English, they called it - now, we also call it Trampoline
    House English. The two women are only some years apart, but their lives seem to have been very
    different, in many ways. Anna is here with her family, who came to support her as she delivers
    on her role as Project Art Works artist; at one point, her mum sweetly reminds her that it is
    getting quite late and rest is fundamental for her, and she agrees and eventually leaves,
    because tomorrow will be a long day and it’s difficult for somebody with autism to be ‘on’ for
    sixteen hours straight. Shakira is here with Taufiki, her 14 year old son, who I’ve recently
    seen grow from a sweet lovely kid to a mysterious, silent and cryptic teenager who obviously
    does not want to be in this art thing for a week, but he knows that it’s time to follow mum and
    so he does, collapsing onto every soft surface he comes across throughout the day and frequently
    checking his tiktok.
  </p>
  <p class="t-body">
    As we begin to finalise the details for tomorrow’s workshop - name rounds, how we’ll talk to
    people, what we’ll say - Anna shares some of her ideas for people to feel comfortable in a space
    where they’ve just arrived, that we add to our House facilitation methods. We’re all extremely
    tired, but something happens there - Anna picks on it and decides to immortalise the moment. She
    asks us for our emails and sends us all the pictures instantly - as she remarks, they are
    important.

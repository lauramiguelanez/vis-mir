    ‘Our work is about generating an environment that is a creative proposition. When we map a city
    that we work in, we try to create relationships between social care and art institutions. We
    talk to everyone, from the director to the cleaner. The work is more about the process of
    reflecting on people’s lives in an artistic setting - the language of art works as a language
    that curators understand, and the artwork becomes a tool to reframe the way that people who make
    it are valued. Culture changes their status, but the art is the conversation that takes place.
    It’s just that it’s done in a different way: artistic tools become conversation tools. Working
    this way, our practice becomes more collaborative, more immersive, more impulsive, more
    collaborative. The art, in other words, is the conversation. What is understood as ‘art’ - the
    painting, the film, the picture - becomes a trace, a tool, and a language.’

    For us, it’s about using art as a tool to mobilise something bigger than art. We are very
    transparent about the fact that art, to us, is a tool as well as our place of origin: the means
    to an end. We all found our inspiration to create Trampoline House after a long affair with more
    traditional ways of curating, making and exhibiting art. At the same time, this is the spirit in
    which the Indonesian collective ruangrupa are curating this year’s documenta: their experiment –
    because documenta itself really is an experiment this year – aims to bring together different
    artistic collectives across the world and start a two-year long process of working together that
    doesn’t finish after the exhibition is over, which is usually the case. There is an intention to
    influence not just the product of documenta – the art exhibition – but its economic structures,
    to challenge the biennial logic and to create alternative infrastructures for making art and
    sharing knowledge and resources. So in a way, we are all moving from the question of whether it
    is art to the question of what we can do with art and with its structures – how we can affect
    social change.

  "I’m Kate Adams, I’m an artist and co-founder of Project Art Works. I am the mother of a man who's
  39 now with quite complex support needs, and he prompted me to find a way to combine art, life and
  care in work."

<p>
  Cosmologies of Care give visibility to care labour, together with the bodies, environments and
  technologies who are involved, alongside the ambiguity of social care systems. Through placing
  individuals at the centre, they produce healing visions and invite conversations: they mitigate
  systemic violence through visualising social systems of care that affect a person, and how these
  might hamper or enable them. But they can also put in place actual strategies and tools for people
  to reach their goals and aspirations. In making visible, and describing, individual or collective
  human needs, provisions and desires, which are often dismissed in marginalised groups, cosmologies
  can also produce imaginaries and visions for living otherwise, and for building better social
  systems.

    Trace history and emotions around the first cosmology of Kate’s - When did you draw it, and why
    did you feel you needed to draw it? How were you feeling? What was your situation at the time,
    and how did the drawing enhance it? Did you draw it for yourself, your son? Looking at it, and
    knowing your work, it feels like the cosmology is as much a tool for Paul as it is a tool for
    yourself, to situate yourselves in the world.

  <div class="t-notes-el">
    What do cosmologies do when they put people in the centre? What happens to them, how do they
    mobilise emotions? Are they a form of therapeutic activism? I think emotions emerge particularly
    powerfully in cosmology drawing with others because they are relationally produced. When people
    feel that they can take up space, that is a result of the relationship that is created between
    the artist and the participant. But also when people can relate to one another’s experiences.
    Can you describe the process?

    Translation into the space of Trampoline House - what happened? What was meaningful? How did it
    feel working with a community you don’t know? Do you remember any cosmologies in particular?
    What did you take away from this experience - applying the method to a different community?

    The duality of the cosmologies: How are they practical vs utopian (visualising other worlds)?
    Have they changed over time?

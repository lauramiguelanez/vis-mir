  Massaging the Asylum System as Lumbung Practice: Context
</h3>

<p>
  Curated by Trampoline House Artistic Team members Carlota Mir and Sara Alberani, Massaging the
  Asylum System is a collaboration between two collectives and Lumbung members* at documenta
  fifteen: Copenhagen-based refugee justice centre Trampoline House (TH) and UK-based neurodiverse
  collective Project Art Works (PAW). Initiated by Mir and Alberani and funded with money from the
  Lumbung pot after a collective decision-making process, the collaboration emerged from the shared
  affinities between both organisations that were discovered during the Lumbung process. It
  crystallised in two series of public workshops between Copenhagen and Kassel: Massaging the Asylum
  System - A Collective Exploration, and ‘Massaging the Asylum System: Creative Strategies of Care.
</p>

<p>
  In the workshops, we merged the methods from both organisations to create spaces for dialogue and
  friendship and look at the asylum system in Denmark. In this process of sharing conversations and
  strategies, visualising systems of care and control, repositioning ourselves and our communities
  in them, and opening processes up to publics, a specific artistic tool for system visualisation
  became central: created by PAW artist and co-founder Kate Adams and developed throughout the
  Lumbung process, <strong>Cosmologies of Care</strong>
  are large-scale, participatory, circular drawings that help visualise the social systems of care
  that people with complex support needs in the UK and their families must go through to get their
  needs met. They also make care visible as a vital form of labour, and help visualise deeper human
  aspirations - from choice in who to spend time with to living close to the sea - which are often
  overlooked and neglected in the lives of people with disabilities, and, as we came to realise,
  people who are marginalised in other ways.
</p>

<p>
  The translation of the cosmologies into the context of asylum underlined their value as an
  endlessly translatable and adaptable practice that puts people in the centre, helps raise self
  awareness, visualises infrastructures, trauma and desires, and articulates individual thoughts and
  feelings as part of larger collective constellations. Here, translation, circulation, and
  circularity emerge as ongoing motion - artistic practices abandon rigid, individual and authorial
  forms to shift shape, transform and merge, to tell stories of different communities, make the
  invisible visible, and build alliances, also building solidarity and bridges among locales and
  within the exhibition space of documenta fifteen, which became embodied otherwise.
</p>

<p>
  Entitled Cosmologies of Asylum as a reference to both PAW’s artistic methodologies and Trampoline
  House’s community, this <strong>harvest* </strong>presents the fruits of a year-long collective
  conversation between the artistic teams and the larger communities which make up both
  organisations and whose voices resonate here. Beginning with how the Cosmologies first emerged as
  individual tools for self-awareness, the harvest follow the drawings as they move through the
  emotional and physical spaces of Project Art Works, Trampoline House and documenta fifteen.
  Through movement, translations and shifts, the cosmologies become strong tools that help not only
  detect malaise, navigate adversarial systems, express anger, and make visible the invisible: they
  also become essential to voice desires, aspirations and utopias, bringing more joyful futures into
  hopeful perspective.
</p>

<p>
  We were able to propose, initiate and develop this collaboration thanks to the openness of our
  teams and communities, the support of the <strong>Lumbung inter-lokal*</strong> network and its
  practices of resource sharing. Massaging the Asylum System couldn’t have happened without the
  support of Trampoline House co-founder and curator Tone Olaf Nielsen and the close collaboration
  of Project Art Works artists Kate Adams, Tim Corrigan, and Martin Swan. It also couldn’t have
  happened without the input of people in Trampoline House and the support of the Project Art Works
  community. In short, this is a collective venture.
</p>

<p>
  The work took shape as a practice of <strong>Lumbung*</strong> values: friendship, generosity,
  resource sharing, art as life, and regeneration. Curators ruangrupa had initially proposed the
  idea of Lumbung - an Indonesian rice barn - as a collectively governed pot of surplus resources.
</p>
<p>
  Our collaboration was born out of the <strong>collective pot*</strong>, a collectively governed
  economic resource that worked as a way to speculate artistically on how to build and maintain such
  a common structure over time. It was unique in its alliance of two lumbung members experimentally
  bringing together methods that were translated into proposals for Kassel.
</p>

<div class="img-caption">Image: Collective pot + Lumbung members, diagram. Carlota Mir</div>

<p>
  When both of our collectives were invited to participate in documenta fifteen as a Lumbung member,
  one of ruangrupa's statements was: 'Art is rooted in life. Instead of commissioning new art works,
  we asked artists and collectives to keep doing what they do in their localities while harvesting
  it.’ One of the ways that we began building a relationship was the realisation that both of us
  were, literally, doing just that in our proposals to documenta: centring our localities, aiming to
  translate our practices into the space of the exhibition by summoning real lives and stories -
  bodies, emotions, trauma, and joy - and using art as a tool to create public conversations about
  hard and deeply unglamourous topics: asylum and disability. Our work centred on solidarity
  practices and building safer spaces where individual and collective needs can be negotiated and
  stories shared, but always in relationship to larger systems and their oppressions, spreading
  social awareness through creative, clear and direct action.
</p>

<p>
  A massage is a soft, directed action applied to the body that, through intimate connection and
  applying pressure, aims to relieve pain. A practice that must involve two or more people, the
  massage encourages gentle healing and invites openness and the softening of rigid tissues. In this
  spirit, our collaboration sought to create a soft space for meeting, self-awareness and exchange,
  which was (trans)locally rooted but which could eventually translate into the space of Kassel,
  reaching wider publics and engaging unaware passers-by in our political struggles and the topics
  concerning our work, from an approach where they would also have to situate themselves and take on
  an active role. Merging our practices in spirit and materiality, our work became a temporary
  coalition in the Lumbung network: together, we looked at the ambiguous social systems of care and
  control that operate on neurodivergent and migrant communities alike, how to navigate them, and
  what the role of art in that conversation could be.
</p>

<p>
  Combining our situated knowledge, strategies and methods, we eventually chose to focus on the
  cosmologies and translate them to the context of asylum in Denmark through a series of
  collaborative workshops that took place between Trampoline House and Kassel: we explored
  alternative ways to ‘massage’ the system, exercise agency and build solidarity practices that,
  while recognising differences, are essentially exercises in seeing, supporting and embracing one
  another. Using art to create visibility is particularly necessary in the case of communities who
  are marginalised within the already marginalised: rejected asylum seekers, people with profound
  learning disabilities and complex support needs; these are all collectives for whom invisibility
  is a daily reality.
</p>

<p>
  Circulating beyond Trampoline House in Copenhagen, traces of the first series of workshops were
  part of the installations of both organisations in Kassel, paving the way for the second series,
  which involved a public audience and using the collective imagination to re-imagine asylum
  together. Through shared affect, time and joint creative action, our aim was to massage the rigid
  and inhumane asylum system - yes, massage, like a real massage - so that it could become softer
  and more humane.

  From ‘Where is the Art?’ to documenta: on Common Thinking, Friendship and Caring Action
</h3>

<p>
  Our artistic research began by a spontaneous process of alliance and affiliation that was born out
  of the virtual Lumbung Inter-Lokal assemblies between the 14 core collectives - or lumbung members
  - leading up to documenta fifteen, which were initiated online in late 2020, with Project Art
  Works joining in early 2021. The questions we posed and practised in the lumbung inter-lokal
  network during the months leading up to the exhibition informed our collaboration: what does it
  mean to be locally and globally rooted today, and what potential does locality currently hold? How
  can we share knowledge and resources among locales? How should our artistic practices use space to
  redefine our relationship with the public? How can we consider regenerative/collective economies?
  How can we translate our practices into the space of Kassel sustainably, generatively and
  non-extractively?
</p>

<p>
  Out of the different Lumbung groups, there was a particular research group that became the base of
  the collaboration: the Where is the Art?* research group, which both Trampoline House and Project
  Art Works joined, as we both felt that this sarcastic question resonated with the way our
  practices were perceived, but also with our stance towards artistic practice - putting people
  before artworks. We began talking to one another around questions such as: what is art without
  objects? Which artwork can be an example in a way that can be tested in different cultures and
  localities? How do we make art in a place that doesn’t perceive this practice as art?
</p>

<p>
  We both felt strongly that in our practice, ‘the art’ emerged in conversations and processes of
  exchange and collaboration, rather than artefacts, which if they do happen at all, are traces of
  the actual artwork. To quote artist Tania Bruguera, who has previously participated in Trampoline
  House’s artistic programme was also part of documenta fifteen through INSTAR, ‘art should not be
  an event, but a culture of implementation’. Together, we eventually set out to explore our
  alliance within the larger context of interlocal exchanges between practices, artists and
  collectives, but with specific resonances in our practices and a particular translation of
  methodologies that made the process both rare and unique.
</p>

<div class="img-caption">

  the Lumbung network, 2022.
</div>

<p>
  Our conversations also showed that this direct, caring way of working with community, where
  artworks become just a tool or a trace for something much more important, and where human rights
  are put in the centre, is central to both organisations. In this sense, the role of art as a tool
  to imagine reality otherwise, for reworlding, for rethinking relationships, beyond merely fixing,
  or maintaining, what the system has destroyed or discarded, is central to both Project Art Works
  and Trampoline House: there is a common appetite for dismantling established social models through
  the exercise of individual and collective agency and the intention to practise a set of divergent
  logics and tools in a sustained way.
</p>

<p>
  In our exchange, very clear parallels emerged, especially regarding the way that our communities -
  neurodivergent people and refugees - are treated as improductive flesh or ‘surplus’ in society, -
  to borrow a term from the book <i>Health Communism</i>,<sup>4</sup> which mentions both the asylum
  system and disabled communities as specific government-managed carceral-socio-medical systems of
  ‘care’ that produce profitable marginalisation through discipline and systemic/legal processes of
  categorisation that make people vulnerable.<sup>5</sup>
  Concepts such as ‘social murder’ (Engels), ‘slow death’ (Lauren Berlant) ‘social death’ (Orlando
  Patterson/Nicholas Mirzoeff), ‘bare life’ (Giorgio Agamben), or ‘the chain’ (Shakira Kasigwa
  Mukamusoni-Trampoline House) illustrate the ways in which care is exercised as control upon
  certain collectives deemed ‘undesirable’ inside Western capitalist societies. It is the “slow
  violence of the everyday”, as Lauren Berlant puts it, through which our governments’ necropolitics
  allow for the subsistence of marginalised bodies.
</p>

<p>
  Navigating both the asylum system in Denmark and social care systems in the UK, it is easy to get
  stuck in places where the body might be fed and cared for, but the spirit is left to waste. For
  instance, in Sjaelsmark, a remote Danish camp for rejected asylum seekers which we visited upon
  invitation by fellow Trampoline House Artistic Team member Christine,<sup>6</sup> people live in
  bare rooms that resemble prison cells with random roommates, they can’t decorate their rooms or
  cook their own food, they describe the food that they have to eat as ‘inedible’, and every night,
  they are locked in every day at 10 pm. While in Denmark this responds to a deliberate government
  strategy to make people’s mental health waste away in camps over the years, thus deterring them
  from seeking asylum - a tactic that Nicholas Mirzoeff has termed ‘social death’,<sup>7</sup> in
  the UK we find that dehumanisation can still be a consequence of well-meaning, yet still partly
  inadequate social care. According to scholar Jill Bradshaw, despite the changes from
  institutionalised to communal living for learning disabled people in the UK, which are part of a
  larger strategy for the individualisation of care based on catering for a person’s needs as
  opposed to homogenising an entire social group, ‘it is of course possible to transfer many of the
  negative features of institutional living to life in a community house: rigid routines, lack of
  choice, little opportunity to participate in activities both in and out of the home, no control
  over where you live or with whom, limited contact with the wider community…<sup>8</sup> In other
  words, invisibility and dehumanisation are still recurrent realities in social care. This might
  also be partly due to the fact that social care services in the UK have suffered a comprehensive
  process of devaluation, de-funding and privatisation in the last decades.<sup>9</sup>
</p>

<p>
  Basing ourselves on experience rather than theory, we arrived at the same point through
  conversation: this shared perspective by our communities allowed us to reflect on how the
  capitalist organisation of care produces and reproduces our societies’ necropolitical assumptions.
  As Pascale Molinier writes, ‘care is the neuralgic conflict zone’.<sup>10</sup> What is saved and
  what is not, on whom the burden of care work falls and on whom it does not, who is allowed to
  provide care for others and who remains a victim, who lives and who only affords to survive, are
  decisions at the heart of every society, historically formalised by different models of care
  labour organisation.<sup>11</sup> As a consequence of that, social systems of care, which are
  often adversarial, hard to navigate, and have deteriorated enormously in the last decades, often
  fail to detect, let alone attend to an individual’s human needs and aspirations. Because the
  vulnerability of our communities appears to be, to a large extent, system fabricated, it becomes a
  field of intervention: care and control emerge as a shifting dichotomy, causing our work to move
  between two poles: from lack (of proper care) and experience (of being controlled) to freedom to
  (care)/freedom from (control). In the cosmologies, freedom emerges first as speculative futurity,
  and eventually as a potentially tangible outcome: a better asylum system.
</p>

<p>
  In the collaboration process, frictions and antagonisms also emerged, from Trampoline House house
  members feeling a lack of connection with what was perceived as a white, ‘foreign body’, to
  antagonising positions adopted by some people - especially young, educated men with refugee
  backgrounds - for whom joint action seemed to imply an equation of both communities. In other
  words - the fear of being equated with what they perceived as a weaker Other - and thus
  re-marginalised - emerged in parts of the process, attesting to the reality that self-perceived
  hierarchies also exist within different marginalised groups, particularly in regards to gender,
  class or ability. In these moments, it was always important to keep language accessible, to be
  very transparent, and to underline and uphold our situated positions and differences, so as to
  invite non-judgemental openness and mutual understanding.
</p>

<p>
  These intersections had other tangible outcomes: it is not coincidental that there were no
  disabled or neurodivergent refugees at Trampoline House: people with disabilities, old age and
  complex support needs in the asylum system are kept in camps in Jutland (another island three
  hours north-west of Copenhagen) in conditions of severe isolation - and that is if they make it to
  Denmark at all, as disabled people are much less likely to migrate in the first place.<sup
    >12</sup
  >
  Sadly, through the years, Trampoline House has not had the means to bring people from Jutland into
  the House. In the individual cases in the house where disability is a result of the physical
  trauma suffered during the migration journey, we didn’t succeed in finding an appropriate way to
  discuss the topic in a way that the story could move from the personal to the systemic without
  making the person uncomfortable. Instead, we chose to focus on using PAW’s methodology, rather
  than the thematic intersection of disability and migration, to read the asylum system together and
  focus on aspirations for freedom through ‘massaging’ said system.
</p>

<p>
  Caring, in this context, means struggling, devoting energy and time to transform unequal power
  relations.<sup>13</sup> In this sense, I think it’s important to understand failures not as a
  tragedy, but as opportunities for reflection. Accepting the partial transformative power of caring
  practices is reading these experimentations as material struggles that ask us to “stay in touch
  with the problem”, as Donna Haraway states. In other words: when rehearsing critical caring tools,
  we shouldn’t place ourselves in a scenario of wrong vs right. Rather, we can ask ourselves: what
  can we do differently next time? How can we engage people better? How can we create alliances
  without making people feel that their identities are alienated or without making them feel like
  their differences are threatened? But also - how can we question hierarchies of oppression
  carefully and not be blind to the ways in which oppressions do intersect? In this sense, in the
  May workshops, we were able to use the cosmologies to analyse the differences between the ways
  that refugees from Ukraine were being given asylum in quick, effective, humane ways, in comparison
  to people from other countries who wait years and years on average. We did this by listening to
  people who had had these very different experiences on the spot: the experience brought about
  feelings of rage by some, but also respect and solidarity. In the September workshops, however,
  where the target participants had shifted to the documenta audience, intersections and alliances
  emerged without frictions. This time, it was the PAW community - the ones who had been able to
  travel to Kassel - that spontaneously joined the workshops and showed empathy and interest to
  contribute to the process of collectively imagining a better asylum system.
</p>

<p>
  There were also other questions of an ethical nature, which touched upon both artistic teams in
  different ways throughout the entire process: how can we remain accountable when we represent
  communities that can’t represent themselves in the context of a big art exhibition - either
  because they are not allowed to be there physically (in the case of asylum seekers), because they
  don’t have an in-depth understanding of the context of an international art biennial (usually down
  to either education or previous experience) or because they don’t communicate with verbal language
  (in the case of some neurominorities)? As much as the aim of both practices is for people to
  represent themselves on their own terms, what are the ethical implications of those limitations in
  representation in this context? But also, what are the implications of showing art by people who
  don’t necessarily consider themselves as artists in a global circuit like documenta fifteen? And
  how does the ambiguity, and inevitable capitalisation processes that take place in the artistic
  realm impact grassroots participation and practice? In the face of these questions, I found that
  there was always a shared willingness to open up, be vulnerable and candid, and bring the
  questions and issues to the forefront, as opposed to shoving them under the carpet.
</p>

<p>
  Reflecting on our collaboration and ‘temporary coalition’, as I have called it before, researcher
  Anne K. Petersen recently wrote that we had ’[taken] art’s visual and political agency seriously,
  casting imagination and its visual materializations as a potential ‘strong card’ in transformative
  politics.’<sup>14</sup> Perhaps that is true. One thing is for sure, and that is the feeling of a
  jointly lived experience. Throughout the 100 days, we were in one another’s spaces, events, and
  things, drew new cosmologies, took portraits and developed solar prints, rushed through production
  lists, presented our collaboration in public events in Kassel with a collective sense of unease
  and vulnerability as we stepped out of our respective comfort zones, shared dinners and printers
  that got lost in mystery Kassel production departments, went dancing after hours to raves and sat
  by beautiful lakes in Kassel to see the sunrise. Together, we experienced documenta fifteen as a
  bittersweet experience of censorship, of joy and tears, of togetherness, sharing a sense of
  direction and survival in the face of hardship and the constant threat of closure over the summer
  of 2022, while proposing radically different forms of embodying artistic practice and being in an
  exhibition space. Ultimately, our process allowed us to learn to question, from a new angle, who
  art is for and what it is for.
</p>

<p>
  While documenta fifteen is over, our practice and relationships are not: a parallel publication
  (featured in the homepage drawing under the visÀvis icon) that centres on the last iteration of
  the programme (Massaging the Asylum Systems: Creative Strategies of Care) is currently in the
  making. Co-produced with our independent Trampoline House publisher visÀvis and the Italian
  Council, it will be launched in Autumn 2023. A full harvest of Massaging the Asylum System will
  hopefully be going to print with Lumbung Books soon, giving way to new translations and adventures
  with the <strong>Lumbung Press*</strong> in Barcelona. Our encounters have already given birth to
  new alliances and relationships inside our different localities, in the form of translocally
  informed, locally rooted projects that use art to raise awareness and create alliances between
  different marginalised groups. At a time of deep political unrest in our various locales, we also
  simply seek to preserve the community bonds we created through writing, talking, and sharing work,
  time and physical space when possible.

  On Trampoline House & Project Art Works at documenta fifteen
</h3>

<p>
  Though very different in aesthetic, character and scope, our proposals for documenta fifteen also
  had something in common: our installations and their public activations were thoughtful
  propositions where art was a vehicle for having difficult conversations about the lives of our
  communities. These were told in the collective first person, placed within the larger framework of
  human rights, and situating agency and direct action as a focus point.
</p>

<p>
  Located in the Hübner building, <strong>Trampoline House’s Castle in Kassel</strong> consisted of
  a warm, cosy, Scandinavian-style living room set up inside a chalk circle - a weak, imaginary
  construction that demarcated the house as a protected space, decidedly yet precariously shielding
  people from the hostility facing migrants in Denmark.
</p>

<p>
  On the outside: a wall, reading - THIS IS WHAT YOU FACE WHEN SEEKING ASYLUM IN DENMARK - listed an
  endless trail of dehumanising protocols by the Danish government, while the combination of space
  and artworks - film and sound pieces, animation, a visit book where visitors could write and share
  their thoughts and feelings, zines, a fashion collection, masks, protest signs - invited the
  viewer to walk around, sit down, read and watch TV and come into contact and direct empathy with
  the reality of Danish - and by extension European - migration policies and their impact on
  people’s dignity. Making visible the fact that our wider community could not be physically present
  in Kassel because of their legal status, our Artistic Team, made up of 14 people with mixed
  refugee and non-refugee backgrounds, put together a programme for the 100 days. We chose to focus
  on very different site activations: a fashion show, public talks, poetry readings, public drawing
  sessions and performances on the migrant question and its political and ethical underpinnings,
  always placing migrant and refugee knowledge, embodiment and experience at the centre, referring
  back to the house for feedback and inviting what we call ‘deprogramming’ - a collective
  questioning of one’s own assumptions, privileges and positions through shared vulnerability and
  affect in the space of the House, whose spirit we had aimed to translate into our living room at
  Hübner.
</p>

<p>
  For its part, <strong>Project Art Works’s</strong> supported studio practice for neurodivergent
  and disabled artists, which spans 20 years, radiated out of the Fredericianum into multiple sites
  across the city, along with collaborations with audiences, carers, neurodivergent people, and
  artists. Their main installation space in the Fridericianum was a direct proposition to have a
  conversation around disability, neurodivergence and complex needs through the coming together of
  three main elements: the open archive - artworks & film - of artists from the PAW collective in
  Hastings; the Cosmologies of Care, with public drawing sessions and circles progressively filling
  up the space and the telling the stories of people, carers and communities, and an immersive
  workshop set-up that worked as a reminder of PAW’s core engagement with neurodivergent people
  through building relationships and sustained supported studio practice. In the space, translations
  of the cosmologies from our joint workshops in Copenhagen also emerged over the weeks, speaking
  about freedom to German-speaking audiences in their mother tongue.

  Glossary
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>*Collective Pot. </strong>The Collective Pot is a collectively governed and economic
  infrastructure that was proposed by ruangrupa to all fourteen Lumbung members. Thanks to the
  Collective Pot, projects benefiting the lumbung community were collectively approved and funded.
  Its aims were: <br />
  1. To develop economic models that liberate us from funding cycles and allow us to become more
  sustainable and independent. <br />
  2. To use the documenta period and platform to start building our relations and collaborations in
  the lumbung, to start connecting our ecosystems beyond the core of the organisations -
  collectives. <br />
  3. To experiment with our interdependency and values: if an individual lumbung member is in need,
  how can we support them through non-monetary and monetary resources in the collective rice barn?
</p>

<div class="img-caption">Image: Collective pot + Lumbung members, diagram. Carlota Mir</div>

<p>
  <strong>*Cosmologies of Care. </strong>Cosmologies of Care are large-scale, participatory,
  circular drawings that help visualise the social systems of care that people with complex support
  needs in the UK must go through to get their needs met and live fulfilling lives. They were
  created by Project Art Works artist Kate Adams and became central pieces in PAW’s documenta
  fifteen methodologies.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>*Harvest. </strong>As a Lumbung practice, harvest refers to artistic recordings of
  discussions and meetings. Harvesters listen, reflect, and depict this process from their own
  perspectives, forms, and artistic practices. Harvests can be humorous, poetic, or candid. They can
  take the shape of a sticky note, a written story, drawing, film, sound piece, or meme. Harvesting
  can be seen as a way of collective writing that enables continuous collective learning, from
  different sensory experiences. Harvests are made to share what is being discussed with absent
  members and the general public and they are present throughout the entire process of documenta
  fifteen, and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>*Lumbung. </strong>Lumbung is an Indonesian rice barn where surplus rice is stored for
  whomever in the community needs it. Lumbung as a collectively-governed architecture for the
  storage of food serves a community’s long-term wellbeing through communal resources and mutual
  care, and it is organised around a set of shared values, collective rituals, and organisational
  principles. Ruangrupa translates and continues this tradition of sharing within our own practice.
  As an artistic and economic model, Lumbung is practised alongside its values of collectivity,
  generosity, humour, trust, independence, curiosity, endurance, regeneration, transparency,
  sufficiency, and connectivity between a multiplicity of locales, rendering them planetary as a
  result.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>*Lumbung Inter-lokal. </strong>Lumbung inter-lokal refers to the international network of
  lumbung members. The term inter-local describes the intertwining of their local practices as well
  as their international dissemination via the network.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>*Lumbung Members. </strong>Lumbung members are community-oriented collectives,
  organisations and institutions invited by ruangrupa and the artistic team to work together to
  further develop the idea and practice of lumbung . Together they form an interdisciplinary
  platform for contemporary art that aims to have an impact beyond the 2022 exhibition. The
  international network of 14 lumbung members is called lumbung inter-lokal. In addition to working
  together on the fundamental ideas and questions of documenta fifteen, the lumbung members – as
  well as the lumbung artists – presented their own projects in the exhibition. They also invited
  other participants with whom to create their artistic works.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>*Lumbung Press. </strong>Lumbung Press is a project by lumbung members, lumbung artists
  and the documenta fifteen artistic team. At its core, it consisted of a collectively operated
  offset printing shop in the documenta hall, its printed products and the accompanying events.
  Outliving the exhibition event, Lumbung Press has now moved to Barcelona, where it currently
  operates.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>*Where is the Art? </strong>was an internal research and discussion group for Lumbung
  members initiated by the Artistic Team of documenta fifteen during the preliminary research stage
  in 2021. Different collectives and group members could sign up according to their interests.
  Periodic sessions and discussions were held and harvested for a number of months, bringing Lumbung
  members together and allowing them to initiate discussions. The title of the group is somewhat
  parodical: it refers to an experience which is shared by most Lumbung members, where, because of
  the collective, and often immaterial nature of their practices, their artistic value is routinely
  questioned. The conversations generated a very fertile ground for contextualising the different
  artistic practices and began to generate exchanges where we could think about these questions
  together.

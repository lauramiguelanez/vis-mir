      idealizations; whereas alliances are always more vulnerable towards mistakes, but they also
      have the capacity to reinvent themselves. Following Brown, this would be like speaking from an
      embodied position, as opposed to an abstract position. Speaking from identity politics, the

      responsibility for that. Hierarchies have always been present in the disabled activist

      good, or it can feel bad. It can do good, it can oppress. Navigating this tension within care
      is vital to both of our communities. We are interested in understanding how so-called social
      systems of care also exercise discipline, marginalisation and control within already
      marginalised groups. Following an ethics of care that comes from expanded feminist knowledge,
      our approach to care has to do with ‘appropriating a toxic terrain and making it capable of
      nurturing again’, as Bellacasa points out. In this sense, positive feelings come from
      reciprocal relationships, joy, creative work, access to social life, and therefore have to do
      with the possibility of acting. What are the creative processes that we can use to face a
      violent system? We want to creatively intervene in the rigid system, connecting our bodies to
      our ability to act.

      ‘The notion of care in Trampoline House has to do with participation and reciprocity, which is
      the opposite of what government care looks like in the West. I get as much care from people in
      the house as I care for people in the house, and I think that’s where the notion of contract
      comes in. In spaces like Trampoline, a new social contract is needed to restore a sense of
      democracy. People enter the house based on a contract of shared ownership – ‘it’s my house,
      it’s your house, it’s our house’. The contract is based on the idea that the house has got
      your back but you also have to do your bit and help out. In this way, this contract gives a
      specific shape to the notion of care and participation. This is very important because
      restoring the ability to contribute and provide care is very difficult if you have spent eight
      years in a camp where nobody is expecting anything of you and where all you can do is sleep

  It&rsquo;s early, I&rsquo;ve already had breakfast and have a bit of time. Though I don&rsquo;t
  believe in God, I realise I am holding back tears and I go inside the church to have a cry before
  I&rsquo;m due to go. I need to see the Turner Prize exhibition eventually, and go meet Kate and
  the others as they set up the event space. I&rsquo;m feeling both slightly uncomfortable to go in
  there alone and really excited about walking into the scene and seeing their bodies move in space
  after a year of covid and online Lumbung meetings which always involved talking, eating dinner,
  dancing, complaining, singing karaoke or plotting at odd, shifting times that always suit some
  around the globe better than others. It kind of feels like a MySpace reunion or any other kind of
  post-Internet set up where you finally meet virtual friends or lovers in the flesh and decide
  whether you actually like them or whether there was too much fantasy or projection poured into the
  virtual relationship to begin with. I have decided I will not be wearing a face mask, because in
  the UK, I don&rsquo;t have to, and I realise I miss randomly touching my face.

  As I walk the streets of Coventry to arrive at the Herbert Gallery for Project Art Works&rsquo;s
  event, I come across a beautiful church, which, as Google informs me, is called Coventry
  Cathedral.&nbsp;
